= Why didn't you use the other plugin x? =

WordPress MU 1.3 is quite old (it's the paralel version of WordPress 2.3).
As such, it hasn't got a lot of features that more recent versions of WordPress offer.
I needed a simple hit counter that could be used in many blogs without having to
mess up with all of the themes' code.
